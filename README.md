# Study project: Snake Game
The Snake Game project is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using React as the frontend framework and Tailwind CSS for styling. The game involves controlling a snake that moves around a grid, eating food to grow longer, while avoiding collisions with itself and the bombs.

With each piece of food consumed, the speed increases, and a new bomb is randomly placed on the board.
You can find a legend in the top-right corner. Below it, you'll also see your top scores.

Have fun!
